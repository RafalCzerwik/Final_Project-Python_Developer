# Final_Project-Python_Developer
 This is my project for the Python Developer course. I'll be developing a platform for listing and selling both new and pre-owned items. The working title for this project is "find," but suggestions for a more fitting name are welcome.  The platform will be developed using Python, utilizing the Django framework for web development, and PostgreSQL for the database.  Stay tuned for updates as I progress with the development. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated as we work towards creating a seamless online shopping experience for everyone.
